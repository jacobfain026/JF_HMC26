    "text": "Over SU24, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at WPIA in Duarte, CA, inspecting 20+ packaging processes to identify and propose safety and cost-saving initiatives.\nThis internship gave me incredible insight into manufacturing and warehouse management and maintenance practices. It was a privilege to work alongside friendly, experienced managers, technicians, and packaging machine operators. By tracking inventories and calculating costs, such as for an initiative to retrofit existing rooms with industrial curtains as pictured in the table to the left, I greatly improved my Excel and organizational skills. I was also able to brainstorm several quick solutions for practical problems. It was very gratifying, for example, to help technicians reconnect pneumatic pumps at better positions and see an immediate increase in comfort and ease-of-use for my operator friends."

    "text": "After the pandemic, my high school’s robotics club shut down. I pushed to restart it over the quarantine in my junior year, and when we returned to campus the following year we were able to build some small robots with VEX hardware. For example, our advisor led the design of an “earthquake machine” pictured at the bottom right. I created the remote-control tennis ball retriever depicted above. A major challenge was figuring out the right spacing and inclination for the ramp and dual conveyor belts, since I had to work around the strict geometries of a limited number of parts. It was a great creative challenge through which I learned how to be much more resourceful.\nMy high school’s science and engineering club hosted several teams to compete in TARC, The American Rocketry Challenge. In this national competition, students design, build, and fly rockets to reach altitude and flight duration goals, somewhere around 800 ft and 42 s, respectively, while safely carrying a payload of one or several eggs. Pictured above is Boomstick Mk2, which we drop-tested and launched using an F-class motor in my senior year, as shown at right. A major challenge was designing a protective carriage for the eggs.\nI designed and built the legs of the above bridge for a civil structures competition through MESA (Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement club) over the pandemic."

    "text": "Mudd Automotive Club: Hybrids\nI’m a co-founder and the vice president of Mudd Automotive Club: Hybrids (MACH), where students are building a massive hybrid go-kart from various scrapped ATV parts, angle iron, and steel tubing. Follow us on Instagram to stay posted on our latest progress!\nI’m a co-founder and the vice president of Mudd’s first auto engineering endeavor, MACH (Mudd Automotive Club).\n\n\n\n\nWelding & Frame Design\nSome of the most fun I’ve had at Mudd has been welding and machining frame pieces for MACH’s go-kart. It’s put all of my machine shop skills to the test! Before and while building the frame, we’ve had to determine positions for crucial structural components, especially where the wheels attach, e.g. the shock tower for the rear axle.\n\n\nElectrical Research\nWhile it’s currently on the back-burner, I’ve helped lead and brainstorm ideas for an electrical subteam within MACH, particularly to explore the possibily of designing our own regenerative braking system.\n\n\nA Bumpy Ride\nMACH had very humble beginnings! We’ve gradually accumulated the materials we now have for the design we’re implementing, after five semesters of searching and tons of ideation and down-selection.\n\n\n\n\nMudd Amateur Rocketry Club\nI’m also the associate lead of Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club (MARC)’s Structures Team, overseeing the design and assembly of a rocket for the Friends of Amateur Rocketry 2025 national competition. Check out our website and follow us on Instagram!\nI serve as the Associate Team Lead on the Structures competition subteam in MARC (Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club), helping manage the design, fabrication, and testing of parts.\n\nAbove is a SolidWorks assembly of Gladius II, MARC’s competition rocket for the 23-24 academic year. We aimed for a goal of 20,000 ft, which posed a great challenge for our Cesaroni O3400 motor. Beyond design input in efforts to minimize the mass of our structural components, I’ve been most active in fabrication efforts, such as waterjetting bulkheads and centering rings, and trimming down fins, before helping my team epoxy everything to our airframe; some of my best work is shown here. We’re also tackling a bonus objective by designing a remote-control rover, and the detachable chute system from which it’ll deploy.\nHere’s our rocket launching! The corkscrewing that the rocket experienced is due to its fins ripping out, since they were not epoxied as securely as they should have been. We’re looking forward to making many improvements to both the rocket’s design itself, and the build process by which we’ll execute that design. All-in-all, it was a great learning experience, and a fun time. Stay tuned for next year’s launch!\n\n\n\nGladius III Design & Validation\nFollowing an unfortunate failure during the FAR24 launch, this year we’re dramatically redesigning our rocket’s structural components. After spearheading the planning of a new approach to assembling the rocket’s aft airframe and running preliminary FEA, I’ve been in correspondence with engineers at Second Order Effects who offered to review our work.\n\n\nGladius II Competition Launch\nTwo years of design and assembly, following a number of lessons learned from a previous failed launch, culminated in this moment. Things went wrong but it was a great learning experience!\n\n\nCustom Remote-Control Rover\nThe Structures Team was hoping to pursue a FAR24 competition bonus by deploying a remote-control rover. I created a harness to mount PCBs and a parachute onto a stripped-down RC car, as well as the parachute itself.\nDuring the descent phase of the launch, teams can deploy an autonomous or remote-control rover to perform reconnaissance tasks. We deconstructed a Team Affiliated MT28 RC car. My teammates integrated the PCBs for our camera, and built a transistor arrangement that deactivates an electromagnet as soon as the rover starts driving, to detach its parachute mount (the green plate I printed and steel disk I cut via lathe shown at left) upon touching down. After several iterations, I designed and printed the pink mounting plate for all these components, including the red screw mounts which clamp down the electromagnet and the mounting plate itself, simultaneously. This will allow the rover to shed the mass and drag of the parachute, seen in the videos at the right and further down below, as we drive it back to the launch site.\nAt one point, we attempted to design around an existing all-terrain rover, which uses helical wheels. We found that downscaling the rover to fit in the rocket and improving its ability to traverse flat surfaces was infeasible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladius II Research & Fabrication\nIn my freshman and sophomore years at Mudd, I contributed to materials selection research for and assembly of MARC’s second competition rocket.\nWe’re taking steps to reduce different components’ masses, without sacrificing structural integrity, since we learned from a previous year’s flight day that certain assembly methods won’t cut it. We’ve spent a lot of time brainstorming and refining design alternatives for structural components, especially their points of attachment, as discussed in my annotated sketches at the right. Shown below is the CAD for a partially-hollowed bulkhead that reflects these efforts, and further down is some of our work in assembling the fins and centering rings.\n\n\n\n\nMudd Robosub Club\nAdditionally, I lead the Mechanical Team in Mudd Robosub Club (MuddSub), guiding the creation of mechanical subsystems for two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that will be deployed at the international Robosub 2025 competition. Take a look at our website and check out our Instagram to track our progress!\nI’m a member of the Fabrication and Mechanical Design teams in MuddSub (Mudd’s RoboSub club), helping with the design, fabrication, and testing of AUV subsystems.\n\n\nTorpedo Launcher Prototype\nThis year, I’ve led the redesigning of a long-defunct torpedo launcher subsystem, resulting in the above prototype.\n\n\nMarker Dropper Prototype\nIn my sophomore year, I helped design and wet test a dropper prototype.\n\n\nAUV Fabrication\nIn my freshman year, I helped machine the bellypan for MuddSub’s first AUV, Alfie, and modified CAD for its new AUV, Crush."

The Mechanical team’s Fabrication subteam is currently figuring out where we can get this guy and other large panels on Crush waterjetted.

In doing so, we transform them into AUVs capable of deployment and data collection at Dana Point in Long Beach, CA. Also included here are technical writing samples, plus examples of my contributions to the team, from circuit design to a regression plotting template you can use! My team compared the measurement accuracy of a thermistor and a thermocouple, at depths determined via pressure sensor.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1reVX4pK4KHjlbY36A042iyFy9b8GDI_mwH2W5gjf5Ec/edit#gid=0\nAt the left is my team testing our AUV at pHake Lake, just north of campus. From here, we identified and debugged issues, such as leakage into our electronics box via capillary action in the thermocouple’s insulation tubes.\nAs the capstone project for our electrical engineering class, Lucas and I, and our other friend Felipe put our new circuit design and analysis skills to the test, by designing a guitar amplifier circuit. In future iterations, we’d add to the existing variable distortion and volume control, like a bass filter. I’ll explore these changes through a personal project. Check out Felipe’s LinkedIn! https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-andrade-fernandes-236877259/\n\n\nWhile it’s still a work in progress, I’m working toward transferring the guitar amplifier circuit that my teammates and I built in E84 to something more permanent. I’m debugging the different components and adding more variability, including to the filters themselves, via potentiometers. For example, one major addition will be variable low-pass filter to control bass.\nIn Harvey Mudd’s core engineering course, students apply the systems and analytics skills they learn in class to a capstone robotics project, assembling a small proportional-controlled underwater robot and its PCB to collect data. In the video, at the Bernard Field Station’s pHake Lake, a pond near campus, my lab partner Lucas and I are sending temperature, pressure, and motion information to a LabVIEW setup offscreen. Getting strange readings, we typical engineering students often find “Oh, it’s just like that.”\n\n\nhttps://muse.io/lalemos1"
