    "text": "Over summer 2024, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at WePackItAll, a health-and-wellness filling and co-packaging company in Duarte and Irwindale, California. Throughout the internship, I inspected 20+ packaging processes to identify and propose safety and cost-saving initiatives, including by speaking directly with the operators running those processes and the managers overseeing them. Besides helping catalog an estimated $250,000 in unused assets, the largest initiative I helped analyze was a recommendation to retrofit existing rooms with industrial curtains, whose calculations are summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis internship gave me incredible insight into manufacturing and warehouse management and maintenance practices. It was a privilege to work alongside friendly, experienced managers, technicians, and packaging machine operators. By tracking inventories and calculating costs, I greatly improved my Excel, organizational, and interpersonal skills. Additionally, I had a few opportunities to brainstorm quick solutions for practical problems. It was very gratifying, for example, to help technicians reconnect pneumatic pumps at better positions and see an immediate increase in comfort and ease-of-use for my operator friends."

    "text": "ShopBot CNC Router Creations\nI attended a proctor training workshop where we learned how to use the ShopBot by milling a set of moustaches on 1/2” plywood. The original idea was a dragon, which morphed into a flame, which morphed into a croissant on fire, which morphed into this weird moustache. I got a feel for the different sketch tools available in PartWorks, the drawing software from which we imported the file into the ShopBot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmateur Carpentry\nI attended a machine shop workshop where students fabricated and assembled custom wood housings for Rockler speakers! I used the miter saw, vertical bandsaw, and several surfacing tools to create this smooth, multicolored housing.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve also turned a number of Rockler pens as gifts for friends on wood lathes!"

    "text": "UPLIFT Christian Club\nUntil it unfortunately faded out during the pandemic, Alhambra High School had a small but thriving Christian student organization. We would have weekly lunches followed by brief worship and prayer sessions. I met up with a few UPLIFT alumni during college!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlhambra High School Robotics Club\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, my high school’s robotics club shut down. I pushed to restart it over the quarantine in my junior year, and when we returned to campus the following year we were able to build some small robots with VEX hardware. For example, our advisor led the design of an “earthquake machine” pictured below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’m most proud of is the remote-control “tennis ball picker-upper” robot I designed. A major challenge was figuring out the right spacing and inclination for the ramp and dual conveyor belts, since I had to work around the strict geometries of a limited number of parts. It was a great creative challenge through which I learned how to be much more resourceful, and ultimately I think it’s characterized my approach to solving engineering problems to this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) Club\nMy high school’s science and engineering club hosted several teams to compete in TARC, The American Rocketry Challenge. In this national competition, students design, build, and fly rockets to reach altitude and flight duration goals, somewhere around 800 ft and 42 s, respectively, while safely carrying a payload of one or several eggs. Pictured below is Boomstick Mk1 (formerly Eagle I), including its diagram and flight simulations in OpenRocket Simulator, which we drop-tested and launched using an F-class motor in my senior year. A major challenge was designing a protective carriage for the eggs, so it was critical that we ensure eggs could survive the parachute deployments before the launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of participating in TARC each year it was hosted at MESA, I attended the club’s hands-on STEM challenges, such as building popsicle bridges and toothpick towers. One year, I designed and built the legs of the balsawood bridge below for a civil structures competition, asynchronously during COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Meetups\nMy high school friends and I have made an effort to hang out at least once almost every time we’re on break from college. Besides revisiting the not-so-old “old days” by playing Minecraft modpacks and competitive multiplayer, we’ve done things like mini-golfing, KBBQ, and hiking at Paradise Falls in California!"

Now, I’m following their example and the example of my parents by striving to care for and love all those around me. Even though I often fail at that, I believe God’s promise that “He who began a good work in you will see it to completion in the day of Christ,” (Philippians 1:6).\nIn particular, it’s been a blessing and honor to lead small group Bible studies of my own and share advice with younger engineering majors through the other clubs I help lead, hopefully serving my underclassmen in the same way that I’ve been served by my upperclassmen.

Follow us on Instagram to stay posted on our latest progress!\nI’m a co-founder and the vice president of Mudd’s first auto engineering endeavor, MACH (Mudd Automotive Club).\n\n\n\n\nWelding & Frame Design\nSome of the most fun I’ve had at Mudd has been welding and machining frame pieces for MACH’s go-kart. It’s put all of my machine shop skills to the test! Before and while building the frame, we’ve had to determine positions for crucial structural components, especially where the wheels attach, e.g. the shock tower for the rear axle.\n\n\nElectrical Research\nWhile it’s currently on the back-burner, I’ve helped lead and brainstorm ideas for an electrical subteam within MACH, particularly to explore the possibily of designing our own regenerative braking system.\n\n\nA Bumpy Ride\nMACH had very humble beginnings! We’ve gradually accumulated the materials we now have for the design we’re implementing, after five semesters of searching and tons of ideation and down-selection.\n\n\n\n\nMudd Amateur Rocketry Club\nI’m also the associate lead of Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club (MARC)’s Structures Team, overseeing the design and assembly of a rocket for the Friends of Amateur Rocketry 2025 national competition. Check out our website and follow us on Instagram!\nI serve as the Associate Team Lead on the Structures competition subteam in MARC (Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club), helping manage the design, fabrication, and testing of parts.\n\nAbove is a SolidWorks assembly of Gladius II, MARC’s competition rocket for the 23-24 academic year. We aimed for a goal of 20,000 ft, which posed a great challenge for our Cesaroni O3400 motor. Beyond design input in efforts to minimize the mass of our structural components, I’ve been most active in fabrication efforts, such as waterjetting bulkheads and centering rings, and trimming down fins, before helping my team epoxy everything to our airframe; some of my best work is shown here. We’re also tackling a bonus objective by designing a remote-control rover, and the detachable chute system from which it’ll deploy.\nHere’s our rocket launching! The corkscrewing that the rocket experienced is due to its fins ripping out, since they were not epoxied as securely as they should have been. We’re looking forward to making many improvements to both the rocket’s design itself, and the build process by which we’ll execute that design. All-in-all, it was a great learning experience, and a fun time. Stay tuned for next year’s launch!\n\n\n\nGladius III Design & Validation\nFollowing an unfortunate failure during the FAR24 launch, this year we’re dramatically redesigning our rocket’s structural components. After spearheading the planning of a new approach to assembling the rocket’s aft airframe and running preliminary SolidWorks finite element analysis (FEA), I’ve been in correspondence with engineers at Second Order Effects who offered to review our work.\n\n\nGladius II Competition Launch\nTwo years of design and assembly, following a number of lessons learned from a previous failed launch, culminated in this moment. Things went wrong but it was a great learning experience!\n\n\nCustom Remote-Control Rover\nThe Structures Team was hoping to pursue a FAR24 competition bonus by deploying a remote-control rover. I created a harness to mount PCBs and a parachute onto a stripped-down RC car, as well as the parachute itself.\nDuring the descent phase of the launch, teams can deploy an autonomous or remote-control rover to perform reconnaissance tasks. We deconstructed a Team Affiliated MT28 RC car. My teammates integrated the PCBs for our camera, and built a transistor arrangement that deactivates an electromagnet as soon as the rover starts driving, to detach its parachute mount (the green plate I printed and steel disk I cut via lathe shown at left) upon touching down. After several iterations, I designed and printed the pink mounting plate for all these components, including the red screw mounts which clamp down the electromagnet and the mounting plate itself, simultaneously. This will allow the rover to shed the mass and drag of the parachute, seen in the videos at the right and further down below, as we drive it back to the launch site.\nAt one point, we attempted to design around an existing all-terrain rover, which uses helical wheels. We found that downscaling the rover to fit in the rocket and improving its ability to traverse flat surfaces was infeasible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladius II Research & Fabrication\nIn my freshman and sophomore years at Mudd, I contributed to materials selection research for and assembly of MARC’s second competition rocket.\nWe’re taking steps to reduce different components’ masses, without sacrificing structural integrity, since we learned from a previous year’s flight day that certain assembly methods won’t cut it. We’ve spent a lot of time brainstorming and refining design alternatives for structural components, especially their points of attachment, as discussed in my annotated sketches at the right. Shown below is the CAD for a partially-hollowed bulkhead that reflects these efforts, and further down is some of our work in assembling the fins and centering rings.\n\nCredit to Andrew for part of C-ring, Max for rigid attachment\nJust attach SOE doc? Or trimmed version that removes stuff Nikolas and Pierce did?\n\n\n\n\n\nMudd Robosub Club\nAdditionally, I lead the Mechanical Team in Mudd Robosub Club (MuddSub), guiding the creation of mechanical subsystems for two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that will be deployed at the international Robosub 2025 competition. Take a look at our website and check out our Instagram to track our progress!\nI’m a member of the Fabrication and Mechanical Design teams in MuddSub (Mudd’s RoboSub club), helping with the design, fabrication, and testing of AUV subsystems.\n\n\nTorpedo Launcher Prototype\nThis year, I’ve led the redesigning of a long-defunct torpedo launcher subsystem, resulting in the above prototype.\n\n\nMarker Dropper Prototype\nIn my sophomore year, I helped design and wet test a dropper prototype.\n\n\nAUV Fabrication\nIn my freshman year, I helped machine the bellypan for MuddSub’s first AUV, Alfie, and modified CAD for its new AUV, Crush."

    "text": "E84 Guitar Amplifier Circuit (WIP Modifications)\nAs the capstone project for Mudd’s core electrical engineering class, students can choose among several potential circuit projects following a series of circuit analysis labs through which they apply concepts from the lectures. My peers Lucas and Felipe and I chose to create our own guitar amplifier circuit, capable of interfacing with and facilitating variable distortion and volume control for Lucas’ electric guitar.\n\n\nI co-designed the circuit, primarily by selecting values for the resistors and capacitors after doing calculations for our desired gain ranges and cutoff frequency based on what I learned in lecture. The circuit as shown below, and our whole research, design, and testing process is explained in much greater depth in our team’s project report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn future iterations, we would ideally add to the existing variable distortion and volume control to reflect real-world guitar amps. While it’s still a work in progress, on my own I’ve been working toward transferring the guitar amplifier circuit to something more permanent, and intend to add more variability, including to the filters themselves, via potentiometers. For example, one major addition will be a variable low-pass filter to control bass. It’s been fun to research circuit topologies online and see that selecting filters and such is as much an art as a science; I see now that you really have to play around with the circuit to get the sounds that you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE80 Circuit Design\nAs a sophomore, E80 “Experimental Engineering” was advertised as being the class that would transform students into real engineers. Honestly, it did! As I worked with peers to modify an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect environmental data, I was exposed to many facets of and design challenges in engineering, technical as well as logistical. I greatly enjoyed and learned so much by creating and debugging circuits to interface with and process signals to and from our AUV’s sensors.\nLooking ahead to our deployment at Dana Point in Long Beach, California, my team chose to compare the measurement accuracy of a thermistor and a thermocouple, at depths determined via pressure sensor. I contributed primarily to the pressure sensor circuit design and the assembly of all of the circuits, but like all of my teammates performed tasks across everything from Arduino programming to MATLAB data collection to Excel data analysis to technical writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE79 Systems Practicum\nIn E79, Harvey Mudd’s core engineering course, students apply the systems and analytics skills they learn in class to a semester-long robotics project, assembling a small proportional-controlled AUV and setting up its printed circuit board (PCB) to collect data. In the video, my lab partner Lucas and I are sending temperature, pressure, and motion information from a deployment at pHake Lake to a LabVIEW setup offscreen.\n\n\nThrough this course, I learned about basic circuit design and filter topographies, got a refresher in Excel, and was exposed to LabVIEW, setting the foundation for other classes. While taking E79, I also became interested in electrical engineering despite having always planned to pursue mechanical engineering. All-in-all, it was also just a fun learning experience! It was very rewarding to test our robot and successfully deploy it at pHake Lake after a gradual process of assembling its components."

My teammates Sam, Bella, Cristina, and Adi and I were assigned to an awesome Mudd alum’s project proposal: find a method of transporting scraps and other waste from a mining claim over rough, steep terrain in Utah. With only $200 at our disposal, after much deliberation we settled on integrating a robust PVC handle system onto a heavy-duty garden cart, which our client has since had success using. It allows him and a friend (as opposed to just one or the other) to push/pull on the cart simultaneously, carrying upwards of 180 lbs of miscellaneous industrial waste 0.75 miles to and from a car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a great exercise in professional engineering practice. Like every member of my team, I had opportunities to lead meetings with our client and our engineering advisor, and contributed not only to the actual work of identifying objectives/functions/constraints and conducting research, design, and assembly, but also project planning and documentation such as creating a bill of materials (BOM), process router, and even our own deadlines. One of the most significant challenges was down-selecting our ideas to land on something feasible for our budget and time constraints, which is of course foundational to any engineering design process. Here are some ideas we moved away from:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE4 Machinist’s Hammer\nIn addition to the team project, E4 has students learn manufacturing techniques and basic GD&T by crafting their iconic machinist’s hammers, utilizing various equipment available on campus. E4 certainly grew my love for hands-on fabrication, and familiarized me with many of the tools I now use in the engineering clubs that I lead.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents begin working up to the hammer by familiarizing themselves with the Machine Shop and Makerspace as they create their hammer stands and PVC ocarinas. Through these fun projects, I picked up a variety of tools like the lasercutter, mill, and lathe, and learned how to track my tolerances along the way. After some unfortunate mistakes where I had to restart parts of my hammer, I also significantly improved my time management and project planning. Most importantly of all, I learned about the important of safe practice around powerful machinery, which has served me well as a shop proctor and mentor to future E4 students."

Even before that I remember thinking a few times, Wow! The drums from this soundtrack kind of sound like the ones in this other soundtrack. I wonder what will happen if I play them at the same time…\nWhen Halo’s twentieth anniversary was approaching, I decided to try doing just that. Having recently learned Audacity for recording audio for a Spanish class, of all things, I tried messing around with the features on the platform and started overlaying parts of my favorite soundtracks from across the Halo games. This resulted in a fairly continuous flow of music, where one theme would kind of fade into another of similar tempo, instruments, or atmosphere. So, I’ve created some “hype medleys” for my favorite game soundtracks, and even a series of “Adventure Anthology” volumes for my favorite film soundtracks (posted on SoundCloud rather than YouTube due to copyright issues)."

Through a variety of smaller sketches and AutoCAD practice, I learned basic drafting techniques and conventions, culminating in the capstone project of designing a house that meets building codes in my hometown of Alhambra, CA. My design philosophy was to prioritize having two bathrooms and a spare room (i.e. for a guest bedroom and/or home office), since those are things that would have been incredibly nice to have growing up. A major challenge was designing around the awkwardness of the space that a car would need to back up into a garage, while still maximizing the usage of the available square footage of the plot of land that the house is intended for. Scroll through this PDF to browse my the full portfolio, including multiple layers of the house! Here’s a snapshot:\n\n\n\n\n\nI submitted this portfolio for an articulation at Rio Hondo College, granting me credit toward its ARCH115 “Introduction to Residential Architecture” class. An interesting additional requirement for the portfolio was additional sketchwork. So, I included the following sketches of a humanoid drone I drew in 7th grade, being vaguely inspired by the Mantis mech suit from Halo 4 and the Veritech Valkyrie jet-fighter-mech-hybrids from the Robotech anime saga. Additionally, I drew a correctly-scaled comparison of Halo 4’s UNSC Mammoth mobile command center, and the largest real-world analog I know of, the Terex Titan, a giant mining haul truck prototype."

    "text": "My Story\nWhether during the summer or the semester, I’m always looking for my next professional engineering experience! Currently, I’m a shop proctor at the HMC Machine Shop, helping people stay safe and solve challenges as they machine parts for classes and personal projects. Last summer, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at WePackItAll, analyzing warehouse packaging lines and recommending changes to increase productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese experiences build upon my knowledge from the versatile general engineering major at Harvey Mudd. Across a range of rigorous engineering courses, I’ve explored technical concepts through hands-on problem-solving in everything from manufacturing, to fluid dynamics, to electronics and computer science.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of class, I help run Harvey Mudd’s engineering clubs. I lead teams to reach out to professional engineers, advocate for funding, and design and build everything from a hybrid go-kart scrapped together from scavenged parts, to an 11-ft long rocket that will launch in the FAR25 national competition, to mechanical subsystems for AUVs that will deploy at the international Robosub 2025 competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a Christian, one day I hope to use my skillset to develop tech that will save lives and improve the standard of living. In the meantime, I strive to show love to those around me through service and shared memories. I’ve grown greatly as a Christian and a man through awesome adventures with friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve also had a blast exploring art! I enjoy creating YouTube videos, from recaps of fun experiences like building a giant Minecraft world to mixes of my favorite film and video game soundtracks, and I’ve drawn a lot of cool stuff, even a building code-compliant house!"

Along with building LEGO sets as a little kid, these were formative experiences for my creativity, both on the technical side in engineering, as well as the, albeit less-present artistic side, particularly in drawing. In fact, the two sides overlap quite a lot!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSketchbook Highlights\nHere are some of my favorite sketches, compiled in a sketchbook I started in freshman year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential Architecture Portfolio\nIn 12th grade, I took a residential drafting/architecture class. I learned basic drafting techniques and conventions, and worked on the capstone project of designing a house that meets building codes in my hometown of Alhambra, California.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic Mixing\nIn my junior year of high school, the Halo video game series had its twentieth anniversary. While I had previously dabbled in YouTube videomaking (and when I say dabbled, I really mean it haha), I felt inspired to make more of a hobby of YouTube, by creating mixes of my favorite video game and film soundtracks, starting with Halo but moving onto a much larger variety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerra Cubus\nAlthough I’ve created a handful of other non-music-focused videos, using the free, open-source editing platform Shotcut, my proudest YouTube video, and really my proudest personal project, is a tour of Terra Cubus. This is a giant kingdom I built in Minecraft over the course of two years following shutdowns during COVID-19."

    "text": "E72 Zipline Optimization Problem\nE72 is easily one of the three most difficult classes I’ve ever taken. With both speed and rigor, it moves students along through a variety of important mathematical and systems engineering skills, from Fourier Transforms to differential equations to optimization algorithms, while simultaneously teaching them (or rather, teaching them to teach themselves) MATLAB. Many long nights of difficult problem sets culminated in the notorious final homework assignment, in which students calculate zipline’s optimal vertical drop and wire rope tension to meet exit velocity constraints while maximizing the speeds that one of three weight classes of riders will experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described in the full PDF, my approach was to compute information for all three weight classes to meet the velocity constraints, by interfacing with a master script that computed the optimal zipline parameters, then passed them into a third file to generate plots and verify the constraints. Through this assignment and many other challenges, including by taking advantage of quintessential MATLAB tools such as anonymous functions and fmincon, I became much more confident in my analytical intuition, MATLAB capabilities, and ability to stick through a difficult problem and debug confusing code.\n\n\n\nE80 Technical Memorandum & Team Report\nBeyond requiring that students do a lot of robot design and debugging, another way in which I feel that E80 really did transform me and my peers into “real engineers” is through its emphasis on other elements of engineering, such as by pushing us to grow in team dynamics and task delegation, as well as diving into the physical theory and mathematics behind fluid dynamics, similitude for modeling, data regression, and more.\nMy teammates Naomi, Troy, and Tali and I split up work across a huge variety of areas, each of us getting to explore if not specialize in everything from Arduino programming to MATLAB data collection to Excel data analysis to technical writing.\nLooking ahead to our deployment at Dana Point in Long Beach, California, my team chose to compare the measurement accuracy of a thermistor and a thermocouple, at depths determined via pressure sensor. I contributed primarily to the pressure sensor circuit design and the assembly of all of the circuits, but like all of my teammates performed tasks across everything from\nPrior to deploying our modified AUVs to collect data, as well as in the process of analyzing that data, E80 students complete a number of writeups to advance their technical writing and analytical skills.\nBelow is my team testing our AUV at pHake Lake, just north of Harvey Mudd’s campus. From here, we identified and debugged issues, such as leakage into our electronics box via capillary action in the thermocouple’s insulation tubes.\nas part of our analysis, I created this handy linear regression template\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important conclusion was that our robot didn’t need to be redesigned for better hydrodynamics to still move efficiently underwater\n\n&lt;p&gt;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These findings are elaborated on in my team’s &lt;a href=\"9https://drive.google.com/file/d/15csoVUgetDNcze0qIiI11_JCYX8QlxJQ/view\"&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"quarto-navigation-envelope\" class=\"hidden\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"hidden quarto-markdown-envelope-contents\" data-render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1zaWRlYmFyLXRpdGxl\"&gt;Jacob Fain HMC’26&lt;/span&gt;

My team created this guitar amplifier circuit, complete with basic volume and distortion control. Currently, I’m independently modifying our design to add more control features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE80 Circuit Design\nAs a sophomore, E80 “Experimental Engineering” was advertised as being the class that would transform students into real engineers. Honestly, it did! As I worked with peers to modify an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect environmental data, I was exposed to many facets of and design challenges in engineering, especially by creating circuits to interface with our AUV’s sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE79 Systems Practicum\nE80 and many other engineering classes build upon E79 “Introduction to Engineering Systems,” where students explore systems engineering through both class assignments as well as a series of labs in which they build, deploy, and implement basic feedback controls for a simple AUV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis & Optimization\n\nE72 Zipline Optimization Problem\nIn E72 “Applied Mathematics for Engineering,” sophomore engineers learn and expand upon a variety of important mathematical and analytical skills, primarily through the medium of MATLAB across difficult assignments building up to a zipline ride speed optimization problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE80 Technical Memorandum & Team Report\nPrior to deploying our modified AUVs to collect data, as well as in the process of analyzing that data, E80 students complete a number of writeups to advance their technical writing and analytical skills."

From CAD to trigonometry to welding, we’re realizing that dream by building the first hybrid go-kart!\nWe finally bought the parts we needed to start building! Here’s some of us finalizing our go-kart layout and putting parts together. We got great deals on steering and rear axle kits and a 440cc Yamaha snowmobile engine! Someone even donated ATV parts! We have a lot of figuring out to do before we can integrate steering and both the engine and our electric motor.\nIt took us a few semesters of planning, ideating, and accumulating funds to get to where we are now. While we’ve iterated from a large wagon with bicycle wheels (as in my holistic sketch of all major subsystems at the bottom), to a motorcycle and sidecar, to the sleek go-kart design we’ve settled on, our vision for an electric vehicle that collects scrap around campus has remained.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/soonyoungkwon/"

    "text": "Some of my Claremont peers recently established a social justice club dedicated to supporting a marginalized, typically under-the-radar group: student parents, young and/or single moms, and their kids. Cradling Love is an apolitical, non-religious club at the Claremont Colleges that serves this group by hosting speakers that advocate against the social stigma and lack of institutional support that make pregnancy and parenthood during school so much more daunting than it needs to be. We also partner with a variety of local organizations dedicated to serving moms and families, sending club members to volunteer with setup, teardown, and childcare at their events.\nI knew a girl who became pregnant in high school and faced a lot of judgement, not from her family, but from the broader community. I joined Cradling Love in my sophomore year, being convicted to support the cause largely because of that girl’s terrible experience. Since then, I’ve served the club as a secretary, supporting my fellow officers in behind-the-scenes work such as planning and tracking logistics meetings and coordinating outreach and event setup.
