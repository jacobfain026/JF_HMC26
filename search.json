    "text": "Hey! I’m a third-year engineering major at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California. I’m concentrating my studies in mechanical engineering and economics, as I dream of establishing an engineering firm.\nAs a passionate engineer and video editor, I’ve picked up various technical skills, programming languages, and software tools over the years. Explore this website to check out my projects! Below is a quick summary.\n\nWhether during the summer or the semester, I’m always looking for my next professional engineering experience! Currently, I’m a shop proctor at the HMC Machine Shop, helping people stay safe and solve challenges as they machine parts for classes and personal projects. Last summer, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at WePackItAll, analyzing warehouse packaging lines and recommending changes to increase productivity.\n\nThese experiences build upon my knowledge form the versatile general engineering major at Harvey Mudd. Across a range of rigorous engineering courses, I’ve explored technical concepts through hands-on problem-solving in everything from manufacturing, to fluid dynamics, to electronics and computer science.\nOutside of class, I help run Harvey Mudd’s engineering clubs. I lead teams to reach out to professional engineers, advocate for funding, and design and build everything from a hybrid go-kart scrapped together from scavenged parts, to an 11-ft long rocket that will launch in the FAR25 national competition, to mechanical subsystems for AUVs that will deploy at the international Robosub 2025 competition.\nAs a Christian, one day I hope to use my skillset to develop tech that will save lives and improve the standard of living. In the meantime, I strive to show love to those around me through service and shared memories. I’ve grown greatly as a Christian and a man through awesome adventures with friends.\n\nI’ve also had a blast exploring art! I enjoy creating YouTube videos, from recaps of fun experiences to mixes of my favorite film and video game soundtracks, and I’ve drawn a lot of cool stuff, even a building code-compliant house!"
