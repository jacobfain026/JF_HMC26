    "text": "Hey! I’m a third-year engineering major at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California. I’m concentrating my studies in mechanical engineering and economics, as I dream of establishing an engineering firm.\nAs a passionate engineer and video editor, I’ve picked up various technical skills, programming languages, and software tools over the years. Explore this website to check out my projects! Below is a quick summary.\n\nWhether during the summer or the semester, I’m always looking for my next professional engineering experience! Currently, I’m a shop proctor at the HMC Machine Shop, helping people stay safe and solve challenges as they machine parts for classes and personal projects. Last summer, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at WePackItAll, analyzing warehouse packaging lines and recommending changes to increase productivity.\n\nThese experiences build upon my knowledge form the versatile general engineering major at Harvey Mudd. Across a range of rigorous engineering courses, I’ve explored technical concepts through hands-on problem-solving in everything from manufacturing, to fluid dynamics, to electronics and computer science.\n\nOutside of class, I help run Harvey Mudd’s engineering clubs. I lead teams to reach out to professional engineers, advocate for funding, and design and build everything from a hybrid go-kart scrapped together from scavenged parts, to an 11-ft long rocket that will launch in the FAR25 national competition, to mechanical subsystems for AUVs that will deploy at the international Robosub 2025 competition.\n\nAs a Christian, one day I hope to use my skillset to develop tech that will save lives and improve the standard of living. In the meantime, I strive to show love to those around me through service and shared memories. I’ve grown greatly as a Christian and a man through awesome adventures with friends.\n\nI’ve also had a blast exploring art! I enjoy creating YouTube videos, from recaps of fun experiences to mixes of my favorite film and video game soundtracks, and I’ve drawn a lot of cool stuff, even a building code-compliant house!"

    "text": "After the pandemic, my high school’s robotics club shut down. I pushed to restart it over the quarantine in my junior year, and when we returned to campus the following year we were able to build some small robots with VEX hardware. For example, our advisor led the design of an “earthquake machine” pictured at the bottom right. I created the remote-control tennis ball retriever depicted above. A major challenge was figuring out the right spacing and inclination for the ramp and dual conveyor belts, since I had to work around the strict geometries of a limited number of parts. It was a great creative challenge through which I learned how to be much more resourceful.\nMy high school’s science and engineering club hosted several teams to compete in TARC, The American Rocketry Challenge. In this national competition, students design, build, and fly rockets to reach altitude and flight duration goals, somewhere around 800 ft and 42 s, respectively, while safely carrying a payload of one or several eggs. Pictured above is Boomstick Mk2, which we drop-tested and launched using an F-class motor in my senior year, as shown at right. A major challenge was designing a protective carriage for the eggs."

    "text": "Mudd Automotive Club: Hybrids\nI’m a co-founder and the vice president of Mudd Automotive Club: Hybrids (MACH), where students are building a massive hybrid go-kart from various scrapped ATV parts, angle iron, and steel tubing. Follow us on Instagram to stay posted on our latest progress!\n\n\nWelding & Frame Design\nSome of the most fun I’ve had at Mudd has been welding and machining frame pieces for MACH’s go-kart. It’s put all of my machine shop skills to the test! Before and while building the frame, we’ve had to determine positions for crucial structural components, especially where the wheels attach, e.g. the shock tower for the rear axle.\n\n\nElectrical Research\nWhile it’s currently on the back-burner, I’ve helped lead and brainstorm ideas for an electrical subteam within MACH, particularly to explore the possibily of designing our own regenerative braking system.\n\n\nA Bumpy Ride\nMACH had very humble beginnings! We’ve gradually accumulated the materials we now have for the design we’re implementing, after five semesters of searching and tons of ideation and down-selection.\n\n\n\n\nMudd Amateur Rocketry Club\nI’m also the associate lead of Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club (MARC)’s Structures Team, overseeing the design and assembly of a rocket for the Friends of Amateur Rocketry 2025 national competition. Check out our website and follow us on Instagram!\n\n\nGladius III Design & Validation\nFollowing an unfortunate failure during the FAR24 launch, this year we’re dramatically redesigning our rocket’s structural components. After spearheading the planning of a new approach to assembling the rocket’s aft airframe and running preliminary FEA, I’ve been in correspondence with engineers at Second Order Effects who offered to review our work.\n\n\nGladius II Competition Launch\nTwo years of design and assembly, following a number of lessons learned from a previous failed launch, culminated in this moment. Things went wrong but it was a great learning experience!\n\n\nCustom Remote-Control Rover\nThe Structures Team was hoping to pursue a FAR24 competition bonus by deploying a remote-control rover. I created a harness to mount PCBs and a parachute onto a stripped-down RC car, as well as the parachute itself.\n\n\nGladius II Research & Fabrication\nIn my freshman and sophomore years at Mudd, I contributed to materials selection research for and assembly of MARC’s second competition rocket.\n\n\n\n\nMudd Robosub Club\nAdditionally, I lead the Mechanical Team in Mudd Robosub Club (MuddSub), guiding the creation of mechanical subsystems for two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that will be deployed at the international Robosub 2025 competition. Take a look at our website and check out our Instagram to track our progress!\n\n\nTorpedo Launcher Prototype\nThis year, I’ve led the redesigning of a long-defunct torpedo launcher subsystem, resulting in the above prototype.\n\n\nMarker Dropper Prototype\nIn my sophomore year, I helped design and wet test a dropper prototype.\n\n\nAUV Fabrication\nIn my freshman year, I helped machine the bellypan for MuddSub’s first AUV, Alfie, and modified CAD for its new AUV, Crush."
