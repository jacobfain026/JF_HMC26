    "text": "Over summer 2024, I worked as a mechanical engineering intern at WePackItAll, a health-and-wellness filling and co-packaging company in Duarte and Irwindale, California. Throughout the internship, I inspected 20+ packaging processes to identify and propose safety and cost-saving initiatives, including by speaking directly with the operators running those processes and the managers overseeing them. Besides assisting technicians in cataloging an estimated $250,000 in unused assets, the largest initiative I helped analyze was a recommendation to retrofit existing rooms with industrial curtains, whose calculations are summarized in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis internship gave me incredible insight into manufacturing and warehouse management and maintenance practices. It was a privilege to work alongside friendly, experienced managers, technicians, and packaging machine operators. By tracking inventories and calculating costs, I greatly improved my Excel, organizational, and interpersonal skills. Additionally, I had a few opportunities to brainstorm quick solutions for practical problems. It was very gratifying, for example, to help technicians reconnect pneumatic pumps at better positions and see an immediate increase in comfort and ease-of-use for my operator friends."

    "text": "ShopBot CNC Router Creations\nI attended a proctor training workshop where we learned how to use the ShopBot by milling a set of moustaches on 1/2” plywood. The original idea was a dragon, which morphed into a flame, which morphed into a croissant on fire, which morphed into this weird moustache. I got a feel for the different sketch tools available in PartWorks, the drawing software from which we imported the file into the ShopBot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmateur Carpentry\nI attended a machine shop workshop where students fabricated and assembled custom wood housings for Rockler speakers! I used the miter saw, vertical bandsaw, and several surfacing tools to create this smooth, multicolored housing. I’ve also turned a number of Rockler pens as gifts for friends on wood lathes!"

We would have weekly lunches followed by brief worship and prayer sessions. I met up with a few UPLIFT alumni during college, which was a great encouragement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlhambra High School Robotics Club\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, my high school’s robotics club shut down. I pushed to restart it over the quarantine in my junior year, and when we returned to campus the following year we were able to build some small robots with VEX hardware. For example, our advisor led the design of an “earthquake machine” pictured below.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’m most proud of is the remote-control “tennis ball picker-upper” robot I designed. A major challenge was figuring out the right spacing and inclination for the ramp and dual conveyor belts, since I had to work around the strict geometries of a limited number of parts. It was a great creative challenge through which I learned how to be much more resourceful, and ultimately I think it’s characterized my approach to solving engineering problems to this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Club\nMy high school’s science and engineering club hosted several teams to compete in TARC, The American Rocketry Challenge. In this national competition, students design, build, and fly rockets to reach altitude and flight duration goals, somewhere around 800 ft and 42 s, respectively, while safely carrying a payload of one or several eggs. Pictured below is Boomstick Mk1 (formerly Eagle I), including its diagram and flight simulations in OpenRocket Simulator, which we drop-tested and launched using an F-class motor in my senior year. A major challenge was designing a protective carriage for the eggs, representing astronauts, as it was critical that we ensure our “egg-stronauts” could survive the parachute deployments before the launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside of participating in TARC each year it was hosted at MESA, I attended the club’s hands-on STEM challenges, such as building balsawood bridges and toothpick towers. One year, I designed and built the legs of the balsawood bridge below for a civil structures competition, asynchronously during COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Meetups\nMy high school friends and I have made an effort to hang out at least once almost every time we’re on break from college. Besides revisiting the not-so-old “old days” by playing Minecraft modpacks and competitive multiplayer, we’ve done things like mini-golfing, KBBQ, and hiking at Paradise Falls in California!"

The high mass within and flat faces around the volume of the markers is meant to ensure they descend quickly and stay in place after being deployed underwater, which preliminary testing has verified works extremely well.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter we make more progress with finishing touches on assembly for Alfie and return to fabrication of Crush, the AUVs that this and other subsystems will mount onto, we’ll return to working on this dropper prototype, modifying the design to be more compact and actuated by a continuously-controlled servo, instead of a discretely-controlled servo, for higher timing precision."

    "text": "During my freshman and sophomore years, as we were designing and assembling Gladius II in preparation for the launch, I assisted the Structures team in finding materials for structural components and actually fabricating those components, before building the rocket with them. Along with staying wihtin our budget, one guiding principle from the beginning was minimizing mass. Gladius II was designed around a Cesaroni O3400 motor, which would need every mass reduction it could get to achieve our ambitious altitude goal of 20,000 ft, from which we have since downscaled. I compared stress-strain curves and research abstracts for different aluminum alloys and composites, and brainstormed design alternatives for hollowing out parts to reduce mass (which we ultimately didn’t, as the savings were negligible). This helped my team settle on structural FRP for the centering rings and bulkheads, and identify ways to move forward for attaching components securely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond design input in efforts to minimize the mass of these structural components, I was most active in their fabrication, such as waterjetting bulkheads and centering rings, and trimming down fins via dremel, before helping my team epoxy everything to our airframe. Much of that experience will come in handy this year as we move from design to fabrication of Gladius III. To this day I’m still pretty proud of how tightly I managed to align our “pentagonalized centering rings” on the waterjet bed. These were designed by Structures veteran Anthony so that we could place them on their flat side on the mill bed and precisely drill out a screw hole on the opposing rounded side, achieving a flush fit with the airframe."

    "text": "Besides growing in my faith and friendships, perhaps the best part of college has been the opportunities to dive into awesome, student-led engineering projects. It’s a genuine privilege and joy to build on the work of students and faculty who started clubs long before I began attending Mudd, and I hope to contribute to the legacy of these clubs not only for my own engineering experience, but especially to provide opportunities for future students. The following projects have enabled me to explore both sides of that hope.\n\nMudd Automotive Club: Hybrids\nI’m a co-founder and the vice president of Mudd Automotive Club: Hybrids (MACH), Mudd’s first automotive engineering endeavor, where students are building a massive hybrid go-kart from various scrapped ATV parts, angle iron, and steel tubing. Follow us on Instagram to stay posted on our latest progress!\n\nFrame Construction\nSome of the most fun I’ve had at Mudd has been welding and machining frame pieces for MACH’s go-kart. It’s put all of my machine shop skills to the test! Before and while building the frame, we’ve had to calculate positions for crucial structural components, especially where the wheels attach, e.g. the shock tower for the rear axle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrical Research\nWhile it’s currently on the back-burner, I’ve helped lead and brainstorm ideas for an electrical subteam within MACH, particularly to explore the possibily of designing our own regenerative braking system.\n![]\n\n\nA Bumpy Ride\nAs far as we’ve come, MACH had very humble beginnings. We’ve gradually accumulated the materials we now have for the design we’re implementing, after five semesters of searching and tons of ideation and down-selection.\n\n\n\n\nMudd Amateur Rocketry Club\nI’m also the associate lead of Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club (MARC)’s Structures Team, overseeing the design and assembly of a rocket for the Friends of Amateur Rocketry 2025 national competition. Check out our website and follow us on Instagram!\nI serve as the Associate Team Lead on the Structures competition subteam in MARC (Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club), helping manage the design, fabrication, and testing of parts.\n{fig-alt=“Photo of Gladius II blasting off from the launchpad at FAR24.” fig-align=center width = 30%}\nHere’s our rocket launching! The corkscrewing that the rocket experienced is due to its fins ripping out, since they were not epoxied as securely as they should have been. We’re looking forward to making many improvements to both the rocket’s design itself, and the build process by which we’ll execute that design. All-in-all, it was a great learning experience, and a fun time. Stay tuned for next year’s launch!\n\nGladius III Design & Validation\nFollowing an unfortunate failure during the FAR24 launch, this year we’re dramatically redesigning our rocket’s structural components. After spearheading the planning of a new approach to assembling the rocket’s aft airframe and running preliminary SolidWorks finite element analysis (FEA), I’ve been in correspondence with the pros at Second Order Effects, who had previously offered to review our work.\n\n\nGladius II Competition Launch\nTwo years of design and assembly, following a number of lessons learned from a previous failed launch, culminated in this moment. Things went wrong but it was a great learning experience!\n\n\n\n\nCustom Remote-Control Rover\nThe Structures Team was hoping to pursue a FAR24 bonus competition objective by deploying a remote-control rover. I created a harness to mount PCBs and a parachute onto a stripped-down RC car, and built the parachute itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"quarto-layout-cell\" style=\"flex-basis: 50.0%;justify-content: flex-start;\"&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladius II Research & Fabrication\nIn my freshman and sophomore years at Mudd, I contributed to materials selection research for and assembly of MARC’s second competition rocket. We aimed for a goal of 20,000 ft, which posed a great challenge for our Cesaroni O3400 motor, so we took many steps to reduce component masses.\n\n\n\n\nMudd Robosub Club\nAdditionally, I lead the Mechanical Team in Mudd Robosub Club (MuddSub), guiding the design, fabrication, and testing of mechanical subsystems for two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that will be deployed at the international Robosub 2025 competition. Take a look at our website and check out our Instagram to track our progress!\n\n\nTorpedo Launcher Prototype\nThis year, I’ve led the redesigning of a long-defunct torpedo launcher subsystem. Our next\n\n\nMarker Dropper Prototype\nIn my sophomore year, I helped design and wet test a dropper prototype, a system capable of staggered deployment of markers for a competition objective.\n\n\nAUV Fabrication\nIn my freshman year, I helped machine the bellypan for MuddSub’s first AUV, Alfie, and modified CAD for its new AUV, Crush. After finishing the torpedo launcher prototype, we’re moving on to picking up where Mudd left off with fabrication."

Our next steps are to mount the rear axle, then figure out how to rig the steering and where and how to mount the electric motor and ICE motor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning how to MIG weld to build the frame has been a blast! I’m no expert by any means, but it’s rewarding to see how my weld quality has improved over just a handful of sessions. Below is a clip of one of my earlier welds, from before we were donated ATV parts, when we were still anticipating using a mini go-kart rear axle kit. It’s also been fun to relearn as well as teach new members how to use some of the equipment in the Mudd Makerspace and Machine Shop to get the frame components to size before welding them.\n\n\nMany members have been instrumental in frame design and assembly; for example, Lily frequently creates sketches that help us visualize the three-dimensionality of the go-kart and its various sections, and Josaphat helped translate our frame into CAD. Befoer that, our work began very humbly with sketching out the frame on butcher paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the general frame shape is something that we’ve played by ear, once the base layer was assembled we moved on to more deliberately determining where and how to attach vertical components to stiffen the frame and interface with the front and rear wheels, especially once we realized we had to make changes to fit the ginormous ATV wheels we now have.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo that end, for example, Felipe took measurements of the rear axle, and then from there I attempted to calculate the relative spacing between its two mounting points, designing with the goal of having the shock tower vertically oriented when not under load. These calculations helped constrain the design space of the entire rear frame and transmission area of the go-kart, which is something we initially didn’t know where to begin, although they need to be modified to account for the fact that we’re designing the go-kart to be “stinkbugged” (in which the frame sinks below the horizontal, from the rear to the front)."

Our team began by deconstructing a Team Associated MT28 RC car. Previous team lead Allison integrated the PCBs for our camera, and built a transistor arrangement that deactivates an electromagnet as soon as the rover starts driving, to detach its parachute mount, a steel disk I cut via lathe and embedded into a 3D-printed plate, upon touching down. This would allow the rover to shed the mass and drag of the parachute as we drove it back to the launch site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver several iterations, I designed and printed the mounting plate that interfaces with all of these components, including screw mounts that clamp down the electromagnet and the mounting plate itself, simultaneously. One constraint I kept in mind as I created the mount’s CAD was ensuring that the electromagnet was positioned roughly near the center of mass of the final assembly, to ensure that the rover body would be roughly flat upon touchdown, taking full advantage of its suspension to minimize the risk of damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt one point, we attempted to modify an existing all-terrain rover, which uses helical wheels. After experimenting with someone’s prototype of that rover, and determining that even with TPU filament, the helical wheels just couldn’t get traction on concrete or dirt or sand or rocks, we found that further modifying the rover and downscaling it to fit in the rocket was no longer worth pursuing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA major subchallenge for designing the rover was figuring out how to create the parachute it would connect to. With my teammates Anthony and Sebastian, after calculating the area needed for a maximum landing speed of 2.5 m/s, I built and tested two versions of a custom parachute cut from a massive polyethylene sheet, which would attach to the parachute mount via plastic cords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"quarto-layout-cell\" style=\"flex-basis: 25.0%;justify-content: flex-start;\"&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"quarto-layout-cell\" style=\"flex-basis: 25.0%;justify-content: flex-start;\"&gt;"

It’s been a surprisingly ambitious undertaking, considering we know of no prior automotive engineering projects, courses, or specialists at Mudd.\nThe dream began with the idea of building an electric vehicle from bicycle parts to collect the surprisingly not-insignificant amount of scrap material around the Claremont Colleges, demonstrating our values as future engineers of sustainability, resourcefulness, and community. The idea began to take shape as some kind of electric motorcycle and sidecar. Then, after five semesters of planning, ideating, and petitioning for a total of $2,900 from our student body, the design evolved into a sleek, full-on hybrid go-kart, which will incorporate an electric motor and 440cc Yamaha snowmobile engine we found a great deal on, and even ATV parts that someone donated! Below is an intermediate design sketched by one of our members, Young.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we’ve settled on this go-kart design, our vision of an electric vehicle that collects scrap around campus has lived on as we’re now working on hybridizing our frame, exploring both an electric motor and ICE motor in parallel. Beyond contributing to just about every aspect of design and assembly, I’m continuing to advance that vision by helping manage our club’s meetings, budget, and documentation as vice president. I still remember the excitement from when we had one of our first general meetings, where we ran through introductions to our leadership team and initial ideas on a Miro board, then began collecting and fleshing out ideas on a whiteboard. I even sketched out a pretty thorough diagram of what we once called “Beats Walkin’ 2” in honor of Caden’s bicycle. The journey since then has been a fun ride!"

As I worked with peers to modify an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect environmental data, I was exposed to many facets of and design challenges in engineering, especially by creating circuits to interface with our AUV’s sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE79 Systems Practicum\nE80 and many other engineering classes build upon E79 “Introduction to Engineering Systems,” where students explore systems engineering through class assignments as well as a series of labs in which they build, deploy, and implement basic feedback controls for a simple underwater robot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis & Optimization\n\nE72 Zipline Optimization Problem\nIn E72 “Applied Mathematics for Engineering,” sophomore engineers learn and expand upon a variety of important mathematical and analytical skills, primarily through the medium of MATLAB. Difficult assignments build up to a zipline ride speed optimization problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE80 Technical Memorandum & Team Report\nPrior to deploying our modified AUVs to collect data, as well as in the process of analyzing that data, E80 students complete a number of writeups to advance their technical writing and analytical skills."

    "text": "E72 Zipline Optimization Problem\nE72 is easily one of the most difficult classes I’ve ever taken. With both speed and rigor, it moves students along through a variety of important mathematical and systems engineering skills, from Fourier Transforms to differential equations to optimization algorithms, while simultaneously teaching them (or rather, teaching them to teach themselves) MATLAB. Many long nights of difficult problem sets culminated in the notorious final homework assignment, in which students calculate a zipline’s optimal vertical drop and wire rope tension to meet exit velocity constraints while maximizing the speeds that one of three weight classes of riders will experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described in the full PDF, my approach was to compute information for all three weight classes to meet the velocity constraints, by interfacing with a master script that computed the optimal zipline parameters, then passed them into a third file to generate plots and verify the constraints. Through this assignment and many other challenges, including by taking advantage of quintessential MATLAB tools such as anonymous functions and fmincon, I became much more confident in my analytical intuition, MATLAB capabilities, and ability to stick through a difficult problem and debug complex code.\n\n\n\nE80 Technical Memorandum & Team Report\nBeyond requiring that students conduct robot design and circuit debugging, another way in which E80 really did transform me and my peers into “real engineers” was through its emphasis on other elements of engineering, such as the physical theory and mathematics behind fluid dynamics, similitude for modeling, data regression, and more. For example, while producing calibration curves to map sensor voltage outputs to the ranges of physical meaaurements they correspond to, I created this handy linear regression template. Beyond developing technical skills such as these, E80 improved my ability to interact with team dynamics and delegate tasks, which has helped me serve as a better leader in extracurricular organizations including Mudd’s engineering clubs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy teammates Naomi, Troy, and Tali began by developing the toolsets we would need to create our own autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through a series of labs. We split up our tasks across a huge variety of areas, each of us getting to explore everything from Arduino programming, to MATLAB data collection, to COMSOL computational fluid dynamics, to Excel data analysis, to hands-on circuit design and assembly. We then modified the base E79 robot to incorporate a set of sensors for our deployment at Dana Point in Long Beach, California, as seen in Naomi’s incredible diagram below. Our experiment compared the measurement accuracy of a thermistor and a thermocouple, by reading the temperatures using both at depths determined via pressure sensor. Below is my team testing our AUV at an artificial lake just north of Harvey Mudd’s campus, prior to the final deployment. From here, we identified and debugged issues, such as leakage into our electronics box via capillary action in the thermocouple’s insulation tubes. Findings from both our testing and final deployment are elaborated upon in my team’s final report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery lab was followed by individual writeups through which students also advanced our technical writing and analysis skills. Each writing assignment focused on a particular toolset, such as statistical analysis or figure organization and description, culminating not only in that final report but also a technical memorandum focusing on findings from our fluid dynamics lab activity. This “tech memo” expanded upon information about similitude covered in both E80’s video lectures and even an E72 assignment, and helped me finally truly connect the dots between theory and application of information from prior physics classes. As an example, one important conclusion that I arrived at, which was directly applicable to my team’s later work, was that our robot didn’t need to be redesigned for better hydrodynamics to move underwater, since COMSOL simulation and wind tunnel testing on a scale model predicted sufficiently small drag.\n\n&lt;p&gt;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"quarto-navigation-envelope\" class=\"hidden\"&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"hidden quarto-markdown-envelope-contents\" data-render-id=\"cXVhcnRvLWludC1zaWRlYmFyLXRpdGxl\"&gt;Jacob Fain HMC’26&lt;/span&gt;

My design philosophy was to prioritize having two bathrooms and a spare room (i.e. for a guest bedroom and/or home office), since those are things that would have been incredibly nice to have growing up. A major challenge was designing around the awkwardness of the space that a car would need to back up into a garage, while still maximizing the usage of the available square footage of the plot of land that the house is intended for. Scroll through this PDF to browse my full portfolio, including multiple layers of the house! Here’s a snapshot:\n\n\n\n\n\nI submitted this portfolio for an articulation at Rio Hondo College, granting me credit toward its ARCH115 “Introduction to Residential Architecture” class. An interesting additional requirement for the portfolio was supplemental sketchwork. So, I included the following sketches of a humanoid drone I drew in 7th grade, being vaguely inspired by the Mantis mech suit from Halo 4 and the Veritech Valkyrie jet-fighter-mech-hybrids from the Robotech anime saga. Additionally, I drew a correctly-scaled comparison of Halo 4’s UNSC Mammoth mobile command center, and the largest real-world analog I know of, the Terex Titan, a giant mining haul truck prototype."

Even before that, I remember thinking a few times, Wow! The drums from this soundtrack kind of sound like the ones in this other soundtrack. I wonder what will happen if I play them at the same time…\nWhen Halo’s twentieth anniversary was approaching, I decided to try doing just that. Having recently learned Audacity for recording audio for a Spanish class, of all things, I tried messing around with the features on the platform and started overlaying parts of my favorite soundtracks from across the Halo games. This resulted in a fairly continuous flow of music, where one theme would kind of fade into another of similar tempo, instruments, or atmosphere. So, I’ve created some “hype medleys” for my favorite game soundtracks, and even a series of “Adventure Anthology” volumes for my favorite film soundtracks (posted on SoundCloud rather than YouTube due to copyright issues)."

My teammates Sam, Bella, Cristina, and Adi and I were assigned to an awesome Mudd alum’s project proposal: find a method of transporting scraps and other waste from a mining claim over rough, steep terrain in Utah. With only $200 at our disposal, after much deliberation we settled on integrating a robust PVC handle system onto a heavy-duty garden cart, which our client has since had success using. It allows him and a friend (as opposed to just one or the other) to push/pull on the cart simultaneously, carrying upwards of 180 lbs of miscellaneous industrial waste 0.75 miles to and from a car.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was a great exercise in professional engineering practice. Like every member of my team, I had opportunities to lead meetings with our client and our engineering advisor, and contributed not only to the actual work of identifying objectives/functions/constraints and conducting research, design, and assembly, but also project planning and documentation such as creating a bill of materials (BOM), process router, and even our own deadlines. One of the most significant challenges was down-selecting our ideas to land on something feasible for our budget and time constraints, which is of course foundational to any engineering design process. Here are some ideas we moved away from:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE4 Machinist’s Hammer\nIn addition to the team project, E4 has students learn manufacturing techniques and basic geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) by crafting their iconic machinist’s hammers, utilizing various equipment available on campus. E4 certainly grew my love for hands-on fabrication, and familiarized me with many of the tools I now use in the engineering clubs that I lead.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents begin working up to the hammer by familiarizing themselves with the Machine Shop and Makerspace as they create their hammer stands and PVC ocarinas. Through these fun projects, I picked up a variety of tools like the lasercutter, mill, and lathe, and learned how to track my tolerances along the way. After some unfortunate mistakes where I had to restart parts of my hammer, I also significantly improved my time management and project planning. Most importantly of all, I learned about the importance of safe practice around powerful machinery, which has served me well as a shop proctor and mentor to future E4 students."

    "text": "E84 Guitar Amplifier Circuit (WIP Modifications)\nAs the capstone project for Mudd’s core electrical engineering class, students can pursue a variety of circuit projects following a series of circuit analysis labs through which they apply concepts from the lectures. My peers Felipe and Lucas and I chose to create our own guitar amplifier circuit, capable of interfacing with and facilitating variable distortion and volume control for Lucas’ electric guitar.\n\n\nI co-designed the circuit, primarily by selecting values for the resistors and capacitors after doing calculations for our desired gain ranges and cutoff frequency, based on what I learned in lecture. The circuit as shown below (KiCad schematic courtesy of Lucas), and our whole research, design, and testing process is explained in much greater depth in our team’s project report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn future iterations, we would ideally add to the existing variable distortion and volume control to reflect real-world guitar amps. While it’s still a work in progress, on my own I’ve been working toward transferring the guitar amplifier circuit to something more permanent, and intend to add more variability, including to the filters themselves, via potentiometers. For example, one major addition will be a variable low-pass filter to control bass. It’s been fun to research circuit topologies online and see that selecting filters and such is as much an art as a science; I see now that you really have to play around with the circuit to get the sounds that you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE80 Circuit Design\nAs a sophomore, E80 “Experimental Engineering” was advertised as being the class that would transform students into real engineers. Honestly, it did! As I worked with peers to modify an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to collect environmental data, I was exposed to many facets of and design challenges in engineering, technical as well as logistical. I greatly enjoyed and learned so much by creating and debugging circuits to interface with and process signals from our AUV’s sensors.\nLooking ahead to our deployment at Dana Point in Long Beach, California, my team chose to compare the measurement accuracy of a thermistor and a thermocouple, at depths determined via pressure sensor. I contributed primarily to the pressure sensor circuit design and the assembly of all of the circuits, but like all of my teammates performed tasks across everything from Arduino programming, to MATLAB data collection, to COMSOL computational fluid dynamics, to Excel data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE79 Systems Practicum\nIn E79, Harvey Mudd’s core engineering course, students apply the systems and analytics skills they learn in class to a semester-long robotics lab project, assembling a small proportional-controlled underwater robot and setting up its printed circuit board (PCB) to collect data. In the video, my lab partner Lucas and I are sending temperature, pressure, and motion information from a deployment at pHake Lake, an artificial lake just north of Harvey Mudd’s campus, to a LabVIEW setup offscreen.\n\n\nThrough this course, I learned about basic circuit design and filter topographies, got a refresher in Excel, and was exposed to LabVIEW, setting the foundation for other classes. While taking E79, I also became interested in electrical engineering, despite having always planned to pursue mechanical engineering. I greatly appreciate that Mudd provides robust coursework in both fields, which will only continue to help me be a versatile engineer. All-in-all, E79 was also just a fun learning experience! It was very rewarding to test our robot and successfully deploy it at pHake Lake, after a gradual process of assembling its components and testing its subsystems."

While these were ultimately small steps, I’m proud to have contributed to a fully-operable custom AUV! Here’s a quick video of MuddSub’s president Ket driving Alfie around in Mudd’s tank room.\n\n\nWhile the video demonstrates that Alfie does its job, the RoboSub competition allows teams to deploy two AUVs simultaneously. Crush is MuddSub’s completely reimagined take on Alfie. Although the majority of the robot was previously designed, I’ve been able to contribute some input to finishing touches, especially now that we’ve moved into fabricating components. This includes Crush’s bellypan, whose geometry I was tasked with realigning with respect to other parts, such as 3D-printed carbon fiber thruster housings, an acrylic camera enclosure, and a lid that was previously milled at a CNC shop. The Mechanical team is preparing to find where to get this and many other components waterjetted and welded professionally, since watertightness is of the utmost importance."

One idea I’ve helped explore is using a potentiometer in series with the go-kart’s batteries. We think this could achieve continuously variable resistance against the motor-turned-generator, and therefore, continuously variable braking power, mimicking a car’s pressure brake pedal. It’s a step up from a crazy idea I had for toggling the motor to be connected between series, series-parallel, and parallel wiring arrangements (to logarithmically adjust braking resistance), in which the latter setup doesn’t actually work even in Falstad. Our research into regenerative braking is on hold for now, but stay tuned to see where we take our ideas!"

Last spring, we put them all together as Structures finished assembling the rocket airframes, in preparation for the FAR-51025UNL national competition. Early in the summer, members from each team met up to make finishing touches and then drive over to the Friends of Amateur Rocketry launch site near California City. It was a three-day affair, since there were teams from universities across the country, and each launch took a couple hours to set up. Soon enough, MARC set up Gladius II on the launch pad. Two years of preparation culminated in this moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"quarto-layout-cell\" style=\"flex-basis: 33.3%;justify-content: flex-start;\"&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, as you may get glimpses of in the video, during ascent the rocket was critically damaged and its trajectory skewed. As some of us walked back from where the rocket landed, and saw that our fins had ripped cleanly out of the aft airframe, we realized immediately that this was the cause of the corkscrewing that Gladius II experienced in flight. In short, the fins were not epoxied as securely as they should have been, and since this prevented the rocket from undergoing its anticipated trajectory, unfortunately we can only guess how other subsystems would have fared during a successful launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this setback, all-in-all it was a great learning experience and overall adventure. Along with lessons learned from the launch of Gladius I two years prior, this has informed our dramatic structural redesigns. Bonding with my team on the road and over dinner, hanging out in a Best Western Inn, scrambling to pack the rocket motor casing during launch setup, and even performing forensics post-launch to figure out what went wrong, simply made the launch trip a fun time."

Nikolas, Pierce, and I created a semi-formal design report highlighting the steps that Structures has taken to respond to Gladius II’s failed launch, from structural redesigns to the selection of a motor with a similar net impulse but lower, safer thrust.\nI’ve been spearheading our complete revamp of the centering rings, which connect the motor tube to the aft airframe body, and other structural components such as the bulkheads that provide internal barriers between Gladius III’s components, which I’ve taught new members how to optimize for maximum hole separation by utilizing SolidWorks’ sketch relations. Some of our key changes are highlighted below, such as my teammate Max’s idea for partially embedding the fins into the centering rings to add further redundancy for preventing them from ripping out. I brainstormed a way of creating screw holes on the centering rings so that they can be held in place at more locations than only using epoxy would allow, and developed a completely new approach to assembling the aft airframe. This time, we’ll slide the entire pre-assembled compound of centering rings, fins, and the motor tube into the rocket body, dramatically increasing internal contact for both load transfer and epoxy bonding surface area.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve also conducted preliminary SolidWorks finite element analysis (FEA) tests to verify that these redesigned structural components can better withstand the expected 2 kN peak motor thrust, which is something we’ll be hearing back from Second Order Effects on shortly. This process has involved a lot of CAD work and configuration, including manually editing SolidWorks material properties at the code level."

    "text": "Besides growing in my faith and friendships, perhaps the best part of college has been the opportunities to dive into awesome, student-led engineering projects. It’s a genuine privilege and joy to build on the work of students and faculty who started clubs long before I began attending Mudd, and I hope to contribute to the legacy of these clubs not only for my own engineering experience, but especially to provide opportunities for future students. The following projects have enabled me to explore both sides of that hope.\n\n\nMudd Automotive Club: Hybrids\nI’m a co-founder and the vice president of Mudd Automotive Club: Hybrids (MACH), Mudd’s first automotive engineering endeavor, where students are building a massive hybrid go-kart from various scrapped ATV parts, angle iron, and steel tubing. Follow us on Instagram to stay posted on our latest progress!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame Construction\nSome of the most fun I’ve had at Mudd has been welding and machining frame pieces for MACH’s go-kart. It’s put all of my machine shop skills to the test! Before and while building the frame, we’ve had to calculate positions for crucial structural components, especially where the wheels attach, e.g. the shock tower for the rear axle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrical Research\nWhile it’s currently on the backburner, I’ve helped lead and brainstorm ideas for an electrical subteam within MACH, particularly to explore the possibily of designing our own regenerative braking system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing MACH - A Bumpy Ride\nAs far as we’ve come, MACH had very humble beginnings. We’ve gradually accumulated the materials we now have for the design we’re implementing, after five semesters of searching and tons of ideation and down-selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMudd Amateur Rocketry Club\nI’m also the associate lead of Mudd Amateur Rocketry Club (MARC)’s Structures Team, overseeing the design and assembly of a rocket for the Friends of Amateur Rocketry 2025 national competition. Check out our website and follow us on Instagram!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladius III Design & Validation\nFollowing an unfortunate failure during the FAR24 launch, this year we’re dramatically redesigning our rocket’s structural components. After spearheading the planning of a new approach to assembling the rocket’s aft airframe and running preliminary SolidWorks finite element analysis (FEA), I’ve been in correspondence with the pros at Second Order Effects, who had previously offered to review our work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladius II Competition Launch\nTwo years of design and assembly, following a number of lessons learned from a previous failed launch, culminated in this moment. Things went wrong but it was a great learning experience!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Remote-Control Rover & Parachute\nThe Structures Team was hoping to pursue a FAR24 bonus competition objective by deploying a remote-control rover. I created a harness to mount PCBs and a parachute onto a stripped-down RC car, and built the parachute itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGladius II Research & Fabrication\nIn my freshman and sophomore years at Mudd, I contributed to materials selection research for and assembly of MARC’s second competition rocket. We aimed for a goal of 20,000 ft, which posed a great challenge for our Cesaroni O3400 motor, so we took many steps to reduce component masses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMudd Robosub Club\nAdditionally, I lead the Mechanical Team in Mudd Robosub Club (MuddSub), guiding the design, fabrication, and testing of mechanical subsystems for two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that will be deployed at the international Robosub 2025 competition. Take a look at our website and check out our Instagram to track our progress!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTorpedo Launcher Prototype\nThis year, I’ve led the redesigning of a long-defunct torpedo launcher subsystem. Our next steps are to refine this prototype, then move on to finishing touches for the AUVs it and other subsystems will attach to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarker Dropper Prototype\nIn my sophomore year, I helped design and wet test a dropper prototype, a system capable of staggered deployment of markers for a competition objective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUV Fabrication\nIn my freshman year, I helped machine the bellypan for MuddSub’s first AUV, Alfie, and modified CAD for its second AUV, Crush. While neither AUV’s mechanical/structural components have been touched in a couple years, I’ll be helping change that this year! As soon as that happens, we’ll have not one, but two AUVs capable of traversing the RoboSub competition course."

    "text": "This fall semester, as the new Mechanical team lead I’ve taken initiative to help resurrect projects that haven’t been touched since during or even before my freshman year. Currently, we’re working on refining this dual torpedo launcher prototype, before moving on to finishing touches for the AUVs it will interface with. The AUVs will fire two torpedos at different points within the underwater obstacle course during the RoboSub competition. Tests to fire the torpedos and determine their buoyancy have revealed the need for significant structural changes (such as those highlighted in the annotated photo), which I’ll continue walking my underclassmen teammates through to help them develop their CAD skills. Fortunately, these tests also acted as a successful proof-of-concept for my design, in that at least we’re on the right track, which is very encouraging since no work has been done for the torpedo competition objective in years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent iteration was a single-torpedo launcher, with a launch pad compressing a spring and held by a retractable pin. Anticipating that this would put a lot of asymmetric stress on the servo that held the pin, as well as other components, my teammate Andrew and I came up with a C-shaped ring that will slip out of eye-bolt hooks attached to the torpedo by rotating to fixed angles. This lets it release the springs smoothly, allowing two torpedos to be fired independently by the same servo, while simultaneously reducing load on that servo. I also designed the torpedos themselves, attempting to achieve good stability and precise trajectories underwater by 3D-printing them with helical fins, and the launcher tubes and base plate from which they are fired."

    "text": "Some of my Claremont peers recently established a social justice club dedicated to supporting a marginalized, typically under-the-radar group: student parents, young and/or single moms, and their kids. Cradling Love is an apolitical, non-religious club at the Claremont Colleges that serves this group by hosting speakers, who advocate against the social stigma and lack of institutional support that make pregnancy and parenthood during school so much more daunting than it needs to be. We also partner with a variety of local organizations dedicated to serving moms and families, sending club members to volunteer with setup, teardown, and childcare at their events.\nI knew a girl who became pregnant in high school and faced a lot of judgement, not from her family, but from the broader community. I joined Cradling Love in my sophomore year, being convicted to support the cause largely because of that girl’s terrible experience. Since then, I’ve served the club as a secretary, supporting my fellow officers in behind-the-scenes work such as planning logistics meetings and coordinating outreach and event setup.
